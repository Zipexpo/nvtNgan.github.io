# Algorithms for detecting community structure in networks

We implement network clustering algorithms. 

Out web application is available at [online demo](http://hexagon.esy.es/).


### Exploring Topics and Events in Political Blogs
The following image shows the top 100 terms in nearly 100,000 political blog posts in last 10 years (from 2006 to 2015). Terms are color-coded by clusters (generated by our algorithm). The red dashed slider on the left controls the cut-off value for cluster formation. Terms appear together in the same political blogs are connected by links. The link thickness indicates the frequency of collocated terms.

### Finding Patterns in the IMDB Co-Star Network
The following image shows community structure for the top 100 actors from [IMDB database](http://www.imdb.com/interfaces) in movies rated 8.5 stars or higher. Links connect co-actors in the same movies and color-coded by thier clusters.

### Evidence in Biological Pathway Literature
The following image shows TimeArcs visualization for Pathway Commons index cards. Time axis goes from left (2002) to right (2014). An arc connects two proteins/complexes at a particular time (based on when the interaction was discovered/ publication year). The colors encode interaction types: green for adds_modification, red for removes_modification, blue for translocation, orange for binds, and pink for increases. A black (and usually thicker) arc indicates multiple interactions between two proteins/complexes which are discovered in the same year. More details and source codes can be found [here](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/TimeArcs/tree/master/IndexCards) or [online demo](http://www2.cs.uic.edu/~tdang/TimeArcs/IndexCards/).
