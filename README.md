# Algorithms for detectingcommunity structure in networks

We implement network clustering algorithms. 

Out web application is available at [online demo](http://hexagon.esy.es/).


### Exploring Topics and Events in Political Blogs
top left. Terms appear together in political blogs are brought closer and connected by arcs. The arc thickness indicates the frequency of collocated terms. More details and source codes can be found [here](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/TimeArcs/tree/master/Text) or [online demo](http://www2.cs.uic.edu/~tdang/TimeArcs/Text/).

### Finding Patterns in the IMDB Co-Star Network
The following image shows TimeArcs visualization for the top 100 actors from [IMDB database](http://www.imdb.com/interfaces) in movies rated 8 stars or higher from 1955 to 2014. Arcs connect co-actors in the same movies and color-coded by movie genres: green for comedy, red for action, blue for drama. More examples and source codes can be found [here](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/TimeArcs/tree/master/IMDB) or [online demo](http://www2.cs.uic.edu/~tdang/TimeArcs/IMDB/).

### Evidence in Biological Pathway Literature
The following image shows TimeArcs visualization for Pathway Commons index cards. Time axis goes from left (2002) to right (2014). An arc connects two proteins/complexes at a particular time (based on when the interaction was discovered/ publication year). The colors encode interaction types: green for adds_modification, red for removes_modification, blue for translocation, orange for binds, and pink for increases. A black (and usually thicker) arc indicates multiple interactions between two proteins/complexes which are discovered in the same year. More details and source codes can be found [here](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/TimeArcs/tree/master/IndexCards) or [online demo](http://www2.cs.uic.edu/~tdang/TimeArcs/IndexCards/).
